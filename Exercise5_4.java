a) Error: The semicolon after the while header causes an infinite loop, and there’s a missing left brace.
Correction: Replace the semicolon by a {, or remove both the ; and the }.

b) Error: Using a floating-point number to control a for statement may not work, because floating-point numbers are represented only approximately by most computers.
Correction: Use an integer, and perform the proper calculation to get the values you desire, as in: for (k = 1; k != 10; k++) {
System.out.println((double) k / 10);
}

c) Error: The missing code is the break statement in the statements for the first case.
Correction: Add a break statement at the end of the statements for the first case. This omission is not necessarily an error if you want the statement of case 2: to execute every time the case 1: statement executes.

d) Error: An improper relational operator is used in the while’s continuation condition.
Correction: Use <= rather than <, or change 10 to 11.

5.6 Both loops are used for iteration however the while loop is more effective when we have no idea of the amount of times a process is suppose to run therefore it uses a sentinel, while a for is used when we know the number of times an event is suppose to occur which is often referred to as counter controlled.

5.7 In this instance a do-while is more effective since we already understand that for a do-while it runs the body at least once before checking the condition.

5.8 The break statement ends a statement or an iteration while continue skips the aspect where it is being called and moves to the next iteration or statement.

5.9 
a). so instead of i+ it should be i++ for the increment the code be something like this while (i = 1; i <= 10, i++)
	System.out.println(i);

b).


c). i think that the increment should be 1-- since are trying to do a count down from 19 -1, therefore the code should look like this 
	for (int i = 19; i > 1; i--)
	System.out.println(i);
	
d). the question for numbers in range 1 - 50 but the condition here give us numbers from 1 - 51 there the fix should like this.
	counter = 0;
	do {
	System.out.println(counter + 1);
	counter += 2;
	} while (counter <= 50);

it prints * four times and # 5 times
